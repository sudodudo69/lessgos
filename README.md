# Dex Copy Trading Bot

This bot will keep a watch on some user's wallet transactions and performs the same operation as that wallet from your account. It performs the same transaction from your wallet using Uniswap Router Contract Call.

The bot support different methods of UniswapV2Router Contract like:

    1) swapExactETHForTokens
    2) swapETHForExactTokens
    3) swapExactTokensForETH
    4) swapTokensForExactETH
    5) swapTokensForExactTokens
    6) swapExactTokensForTokens

If, your watched address is making trade on the routers and calling this function, the bot will directly perform the same trade but with the configuration, that you will be specifying in the config file.
